          <h3>Track your gear</h3>
          <p>
            The Gear Inventory system enables you to meticulously track all your
            equipment. You can input details such as weight, manufacturer info,
            price, and other relevant item specifics. Additionally, you can
            categorize your gear to keep things organized.

          <h3>Create packing lists</h3>
          <p>
            Sorry folks, it's time to retire the spreadsheets. Packstack helps
            you create incredibly detailed, well-organized packing lists without
            copying and pasting. Our modular system lets you easily add items
            from your inventory and experiment with different pack
            configurations.

          <h3>Weight Breakdowns</h3>
          <p>
            Get a detailed, categorized weight breakdown of everything in your
            pack. A weight breakdown allows you to quickly review your weight
            distribution by category.

          <h3>Share packing lists</h3>
          <p>
            Each pack has a dedicated "view only" page that allows you to
            privately share with whomever you want. This is convenient when you
            want to share your packing list with a specific person or audience
            but you don't want it to be public.
